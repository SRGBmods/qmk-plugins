# QMK + SRGB Support - [a Reddit post is found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SignalRGB/comments/1gg4s1z/qmk_support_madness_partnerships_were_willing_to/) #

**One thing of note, if you are attempting to use VIA or Vial to configure your keyboard, is you _must_ quit SignalRGB before running either software. This is a limitation of the raw_hid_send that both VIA and SignalRGB use to talk to your keyboard!**

## Here you will find plugins for QMK keyboards to work with SignalRGB ##

### Please note you must be using QMK firmware with SignalRGB Protocol support added to it to use these plugins ###
[More information available here.](https://docs.signalrgb.com/qmk)

[![Click here to add this repo to SignalRGB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SRGBmods/QMK-Images/main/images/add-to-signalrgb.png)](https://srgbmods.net/s?p=addon/install?url=https://github.com/SRGBmods/qmk-plugins)

Using the above button will help keep your plugins up to date whenever any changes are made to them. (Added by Default to SignalRGB releases now!)

Tech support is available on the [Test Plugin Discord](https://discord.com/invite/J5dwtcNhqC) with the QMK #roles (join #roles and pick the QMK to gain access to the QMK channels!)

### Needs Testing ###
Please see the [\_Needs-Testing](https://github.com/SRGBmods/qmk-plugins/tree/needs-testing) branch if you find your keyboard in there and it works. Please let us know either via the Discord link above or with the Issues system here on GitHub, and thanks for the help!
